Is it in London?

There are some places that lie within the M25 but are not in any London Borough. TFL might operate some buses in these areas,
you might be able to use a London Underground station, but you won't be able to vote in London elections. Depending on your
point of view (usually where you live), these places might be 'in London' or they might not.

This map shows the area within the M25 that is not part of any London Borough. To build this, I used a bunch of new geometry tools
and:

- Used the M25 and A282 roads, noting that the M25 doesnâ€™t fully circle London (the Dartford Crossing is designated as the A282).

- Joined the M25 and A282 roads to form a continuous path.

- Created a convex hull around this path to generate an M25 polygon.

- Loaded a London Wards shapefile to build a polygon representing London.

- Subtracted the London polygon from the M25 polygon to isolate the area within the M25 but outside London.
   
- Created a rectangle covering the UK and subtracted the M25 polygon from it, further refining the area to only within the M25 and outside London.
