A map from the olden-days of web mapping when I worked for a telecoms consultancy.

This is one of our late-vintage maps, from the early 2000s, but we built them in the same
way from the late 90s:

- We took radio planning data from mobile network operators from Planet, Asterix
and other radio planning tools and converted them into GeoTIFFs (with some custom extensions).

- Our home-grown rendering engine (C++/MFC) combined worldwide vector data with the coverage data

- An in-office render farm, controlled by a MS Access-based queue, produced the map tiles

- Front-end interactivity was built using Perl and Flash - to search for places and to provide rudimentary scrolling and panning

By today's standards, the map is pretty basic, but a large number of network operators across the
world embedded these maps in their websites and in-store kiosks.

Image: I _think_ Collins Bartholomew might have provided the map data (I certainly
remember visiting them up in Scotland around that time) and the coverage data
is from some Turkish mobile network (which may or may not still exist).
