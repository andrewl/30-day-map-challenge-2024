This is a map from the olden-days of web mapping. Does that count as vintage?

In the late-90s/early-00s, working
for a telecoms consultancy I built desktop, POS and web mapping applications. We built
a saas-style service that enabled telecoms operators to embed dynamic (for the time)
coverage maps into their websites.

- We took radio planning data from mobile network operators from Planet, Asterix and
other radio planning tools and converted them into GeoTIFFs (with some custom extensions).

- We built our own rendering engine that produced map tiles as gif files, like those below

- built an in-house render-farm running on a bunch of queue on ms access

- front-end interactivity was build using flash - to search for places and to provide rudimentary scrolling and panning, with backend functionality written in Perl

The maps looked

Image: I _think_ Collins Bartholomew might have provided the map data (I certainly
remember visiting them up in Scotland around that time) and the coverage data
is from some Turkish mobile network (which may or may not still exist).
